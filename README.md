# Taxonomy

After cloning the project, you can start it by running the following command:
```bash
./vendor/bin/sail up
```

After it's finished, you can launch the application to test if it's running on [http://localhost/](http://localhost/)

If it's running, you should have the following 3 endpoints available to you:
```
GET  - http://localhost/api/employees/{employee_id}/staff
POST - http://localhost/api/employees
PUT  - http://localhost/api/employees/{employee_id}
```
